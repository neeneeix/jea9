  Perhaps one of the most eventful quarters I'll have this SY!

This was definitely a step-up from our previous lessons in HTML & CSS, from Grade 8 and Quarter 1 now that we almost fully focused on CSS it was really a challenge to figure out how to learn these newer concepts, memorize the never-ending list of values (especially in Lesson 6-7) and figure out what exactly was even being talked about. Grouping information became my best friend and I really had to study out of class because the discussions alone weren't enough for me to fully understand + I was often excused. While I am somewhat disappointed in my quiz 1 (I STUDIED HARD FOR THAT, but I didn't understand a certain part of identification so I failed). I wish for a better performance in the next two quarters as I'm not satisfied yet with this one.<br><br>

Nevertheless, I'm still thankful for our teacher, Ms. Uminga. Even if I found the lessons hard she was still very patient with discussing, very funny and also understanding when we ask for her time for our never-ending list of class projects. Hopefully, with how much time and effort she's put in for us this quarter she also does so for herself -- 2nd quarter was very busy, in the few ICT classes I was able to attend I would say the funniest was when we did oral reci, I am so so glad I got it right! (block=vertical, inline=horizontal).</p><br><br><font color="#999fad" size="2" style="text-align:left;">Thank you again po for all your hard work, Ma'am U!</font><br>
